# Bridge webapp

This package is supposed to grow into HTTP server and web frontend for playing
contract bridge, using my [Bridge project](https://github.com/jasujm/bridge) as
backend.

It’s also a project for me to learn about Node.js and some event driven
programming.

Currently it’s mostly a test suite for stress testing the bridge backend,
though. Run either:

    npm run client-server

or

    npm run peers
