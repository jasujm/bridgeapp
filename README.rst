This package contains a lightweight webapp for playing contract
bridge, using my `Bridge project <https://github.com/jasujm/bridge>`_
as a backend.

Please check https://bridge.jmoisio.eu/ for an early deployment. I tend to kill
it regularly so games may go away abruptly.

Note! This is very much still work in progress, and is missing features and
documentation.
